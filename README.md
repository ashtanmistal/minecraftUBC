# minecraftUBC

The UBC Minecraft Project is a project that aims to recreate the UBC Vancouver Campus inside a Minecraft world, in a 1:1 scale.

It's built by transforming LiDAR data, operational geospatial data, and various reference imagery through surface reconstruction, data processing, and deep learning algorithms. See the [CVPR Demo Poster](https://github.com/ashtanmistal/minecraftUBC/blob/master/MinecraftUBC-Poster.pdf) to learn more!

**Note: This project uses submodules. If you want to clone the deep learning modules and related subprojects, please clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ashtanmistal/minecraftUBC.git`** If you just want to download the world, there's no need to clone the submodules.

## Server and World Download

**Note: The server is currently offline. Check out the [latest release](http://github.com/ashtanmistal/minecraftUBC/releases/latest) for the world download.**

If you're looking to check out the world on the server or want to chat about the project, please see the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FqbDJNPgDu) where the IP address is shared.

If you're looking for what the world looks like after various processing steps you can check out the `world/development_layers` directory in the latest release.
