# Building Info

**Update: I am no longer looking for help with manual building in the project at this stage. All remaining work will be automated through mesh reconstruction and point cloud processing algorithms, plus deep learning pipelines where necessary.**

Interested in helping build? Make sure you've joined the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FqbDJNPgDu) and then read through this document to get started.

## The Building Process
1. Put your name, discord name, and Minecraft name into the Builders sheet under the [Building Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16vR1eYbdkNVdfTgkR4nw5c2QBYRDDq_WJ4L-AfOAfrM/edit?usp=sharing). Request edit access.
2. Claim a building on the spreadsheet (if already claimed, check with initial builder to join).
3. Please update your progress as you go along on the spreadsheet.
4. Outdoors are the most important part. Interior detailing isn't necessary at this point.
5. Ask for help if you need it!

## WorldEdit Basics

WorldEdit will make your building life so much easier throughout this process. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOOvommDpUA) for a good tutorial if you're new. 

Most importantly, the tools I've used most often are:
- `//set` - This will set the blocks within your selection region to the block you specify. For example, `//set stone` will set all blocks in your selection region to stone.
- `//replace` - This will replace all blocks of a certain type with another type. For example, `//replace stone cobblestone` will replace all stone blocks with cobblestone blocks.
  - You can also use `//replace #existing stone` to replace all blocks that aren't air with stone.
- `//copy` - This will copy the blocks within your selection region to your clipboard.
  - Note that it copies relative to your position to the selection region (so when you paste later, it'll place the blocks around you _relative to your position when you copied_).
- `//paste` - This will paste the blocks in your clipboard to the location of your cursor.
- `//rotate` - This will rotate the blocks in your clipboard. For example, `//rotate 90` will rotate the blocks in your clipboard 90 degrees clockwise. Useful if one side of a building is the exact same as another side. 

## Other Useful Tips and Tools
- Google Earth's 3d data is old but can still be very useful - this is usually my go-to. But note that if a part of a wall sticks out further than the rest (like in Marine Drive) those details are often missed.
- I've also found the ubcresidence Instagram account to be another good photo resource if there's not a lot of Google Maps photos.
- Lots of the "blocks" in UBC don't align with meter chunks, and so some floors might have to be a block taller or a block shorter than the rest of them - That's okay as the focus is on the exteriors.
